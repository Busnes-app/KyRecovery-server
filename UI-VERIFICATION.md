# Shared UI verification

## Change

Fix Recovery-specific background/text aliases and stylesheet precedence; contrast checks now inspect the active palette. Shared assets are pinned to ky-ui 0.2.0 with content hashes. Product layouts, saved theme keys and named presets remain local.

## Capture conditions

Captured 2026-09-25 from this branch, using the application UI (not a design mockup). Capsules and retention controls in a real scratch server, with no deposited capsules.

OS-following Busnes Light and Dark were captured at 1280×900 and 390×844 CSS pixels. Browser device scaling may make PNG dimensions larger. Document width stayed within the viewport in these captured states; local navigation/table scrolling is intentional. Screenshots show the selected-page accent, not a complete accessibility audit.

No complete end-to-end product workflow or exhaustive named-theme audit is claimed.

## Checks

go test ./internal/server and node scripts/check-contrast.mjs passed in both palettes. Central ky-ui sync --check verified all ten consumers. Screenshot coverage is Busnes Light/Dark; existing named choices are retained, but not every named palette/page combination was visually exercised.

## Reproduce

Run the Go server with isolated preview data following its README; run the checks above from the repository root. Use System theme, emulate OS light/dark, and inspect both viewport sizes. Do not point preview instances at production data. For KyVault, use a configured development KyIdentity or explicitly labeled read-only browser fixtures; never bypass backend authentication.
